# Testing Privacy Magic

To test the Privacy Magic browser extension, you need to install it in your browser. Here's how to do that:

  1. Go to https://github.com/littletechllc/privacymagic-extension/releases and download a zip file (not the source code) to your Downloads folder:<br>

  2. Open Chrome, click on `⋮ > Extensions > Manage Extensions` to open the Extensions page.<br>

  6. On the toolbar at the top of the window, click on the Extensions icon and "pin" the Privacy Magic icon to the toolbar: <br>

  7. Now browse as normally! Your privacy should be protected. If you find a website isn't working properly, you can click on the Privacy Magic button and turn off protections for that website.<br>
